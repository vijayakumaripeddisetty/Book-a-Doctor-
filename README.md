#  Book a Doctor – Online Doctor Appointment Management System

A full-stack **MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)** web application that enables patients to search for doctors, book appointments, manage consultations, maintain medical records, and receive healthcare services through a secure and user-friendly platform.

---

#  Overview

**Book a Doctor** is designed to simplify the healthcare appointment process by allowing patients to search for doctors based on specialization, schedule appointments, manage bookings, receive notifications, and maintain their medical records online. Doctors can manage their schedules, view appointments, update consultation details, and communicate with patients.

The project follows the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture, providing a clean, modular, scalable, and maintainable codebase.
